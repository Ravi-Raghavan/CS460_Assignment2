\subsection{Nearest Neighbors}
To find the nearest neighbors, the distance was measured using the end-effector positions. For implementation, forward kinematics was used to determine the coordinates of the end-effectors and the Eucliean distance was calculated from the coordinates.

\subsubsection{Search Comparison}
To compare running times between linear search and kd-tree search, the map used was arm\_polygons.npy and the target was [3.14, 0]. When comparing the running time as the number of configurations increased, the k nearest neighbors was set to 3. When comparing the running time as the number of neighbors increased, the number of random configurations was 100.

\subsubsection{Analysis}
For Problem 2, we know that our configuration $q$ for the 2D Rigid Body can be represented as $(x, y, \theta)$ where $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of the rigid body's geometric center and $\theta$ is the degree of rotation of the rigid body with respect to its center. 

Hence, to obtain 5 samples of random collision-free configurations, I followed the following basic steps 5 times! : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item I sampled $x_{rand}$ uniformly from the range $(0, 2)$, I sampled $y_{rand}$ uniformly from the range $(0, 2)$, and I sampled $\theta_{rand}$ uniformly from the range $(-\pi, \pi)$
    \item The configuration I obtained was $(x_{rand}, y_{rand}, \theta_{rand})$
    \item To determine whether this configuration was in the Free Space of the Configuration Space, I converted the configuration to workspace coordinates and applied collision checking(same algorithms I used in Assignment 1)
    \item If the configuration was in the Free Space of the Configuration Space, I kept it
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Collision Detection Review}
To implement collision detection, my methodology can be broken down into two major portions. Let's say we are trying to detect if Polygon P and Q collide. The first thing I did was to construct bounding boxes around each polygon. Essentially, a bounding box for a polygon is akin to drawing a rectangle around the polygon that covers all its corners \newline 

Once the bounding boxes are constructed, when checking for collision, the first thing I check to see is if the bounding boxes for P and Q intersect. If no intersection is detected, I simply return False to indicate that there is NO collision. \newline 

However, if there is a collision detected between the bounding boxes of P and Q, I need to verify this collision. To do this verification, I use the Separating Axis Theorem(SAT). \newline 

Essentially, the main principle behind the Separating Axis Theorem is as follows. If a line/axis exists such that the projections of two polygons onto this line don't overlap, then the polygons don't collide. \newline 

For each edge of both polygons, I computed the normal vector to that edge. Then, I projected each polygon onto that normal vector. If there was a gap in the projections(i.e. there was no overlap in the projections), then I could conclude that there was NO intersection between the two polygons. 

If there was no such gap, I would have to keep continuing this process until I found a normal vector where there was a gap in the projections of the polygons onto this vector. 

At the end of the process, if I did not find any such gap of the projections onto any of the normal vectors, I could conclude that there was a collision between the polygons

\underline{Program Input}: Target Configuration was $[1.5, 0.5, -0.5]$, number of nearest neighbors was 5, and the input list was specified by rigid$\_$configs.npy

\subsubsection{Analysis}
First, I will explain the distance metric to compute the distance between two configurations and how I went about computing this distance.  \newline 

Distance Metric: $D = \alpha d_t + (1 - \alpha) d_r$ \newline 
where $\alpha = 0.7$, $d_t$ is the Euclidean Distance between two configurations, $d_r$ is the Rotational Distance between two configurations. 

Let's say we have two configurations: $(x_1, y_1, \theta_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, \theta_2)$, here is how I would go about computing the distance between the two configurations: \newline 

$d_t = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ \newline 

Let $r$ be the radius of the circle that circumscribes the rectangular rigid body. We can state that $r = \sqrt{(\frac{w}{2})^2 + (\frac{h}{2})^2}$ where $w$ is the width of the rectangle and the $h$ is the height of the rectangle \newline 

$d_r = r * abs(\theta_2 - \theta_1)$ where abs is the absolute value. 

% SECTION 2.3
\subsection{Interpolation Along the Straight Line in the C-Space}
\subsubsection{Analysis}
Let's say we have two configurations: $(x_1, y_1, \theta_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, \theta_2)$. To interpolate along the straight line from $(x_1, y_1, \theta_1)$ to  $(x_2, y_2, \theta_2)$, I would connect $(x_1, y_1, \theta_1)$ to  $(x_2, y_2, \theta_2)$ and then divide the line into multiple segments. \newline 

For example, I would divide the line segment from $(x_1, y_1, \theta_1)$ to  $(x_2, y_2, \theta_2)$ into $n$ segments, and animate the rigid body moving along those n segments.

Configurations are defined as such: \newline 
\begin{align}
    q(t) &= \begin{bmatrix}
           x(t) \\
           y(t) \\
           \theta(t)
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Controls are defined as such: \newline 
\begin{align}
    u(t) &= \begin{bmatrix}
           v(t) \\
           \phi(t)
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Derivative of Configuration is defined as such: \newline 
\begin{align}
    \dot{q}(t) &= \begin{bmatrix}
           v\cos{\theta(t)} \\
           v\sin{\theta(t)} \\
           \frac{v}{L} \tan{\phi}
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

System Dynamics: \newline 
\begin{align}
    q(t + dt) &= q(t) + \dot{q}(t) dt
\end{align}

Instructions to Control Keyboard Animation: \newline 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Up: Increase Velocity
    \item Down: Decrease Velocity
    \item Right: Increase value of $\phi$
    \item Left: Decrease Value of $\phi$
    \item Space: Keep Controls the same and move along trajectory
\end{itemize}

% SECTION 3.2
\subsection{Integration of Dynamics}
Given a starting configuration(i.e. $q(0)$) and a constant control (i.e. $\mu$), I was able to perform the integration of the above system dynamic equation to determine the trajectory of the car. 

To achieve this, I would simply set $dt = \Delta t = 0.01$. Then, the system dynamic equation can be rewritten as such: \newline 
\begin{align}
    q(t + \Delta t) &= q(t) + \dot{q}(t) \Delta t
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    q(t + 0.01) &= q(t) + \dot{q}(t) (0.01)
\end{align}

The Initial Value of this equation is 

\begin{align}
    q(0) &= \begin{bmatrix}
           x_0 \\
           y_0 \\
           \theta_0
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

The control is constant and can be denoted as such: 
\begin{align}
    u &= \begin{bmatrix}
           v \\
           \phi
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

To solve for the Derivative of Configuration: \newline 
\begin{align}
    \dot{q}(t) &= \begin{bmatrix}
           v\cos{\theta(t)} \\
           v\sin{\theta(t)} \\
           \frac{v}{L} \tan{\phi}
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

The problem description denotes $L = 0.2$. Now, all the necessary information is needed to solve the equation $q(t + 0.01) = q(t) + \dot{q}(t) (0.01)$ for the value of the configuration at the next time step!
